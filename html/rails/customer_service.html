<h2><a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation and System Requirements</h2>
              <p>All current versions of HOMER will install and run on any Windows Operating System. There are no minimum requirements for memory or processors, but these may impact performance and your ability to model complex problems in some cases. </p>
              <p>HOMER will run on a Macintosh equipped with a virtual Windows environment, but we do not provide support for that environment.</p>
              <h2><a name="pricing" id="pricing"></a>Pricing</h2>
              <p>HOMER 2 is currently $199 for a 6-month license.              </p>
              <h2><a name="quantity" id="quantity"></a>Quantity Discounts</h2>
              <p>HOMER 2 can now be purchased in any quantity, and activated (&quot;assigned&quot;) when you are ready to use them. Quantities can be shared among users, by a single user over time, or any combination. For example, if you purchase 4 licenses, you can use them 6 months at a time, and get a 10% discount.</p>
              <h2><a name="academic" id="academic"></a>Academic Discounts</h2>
              <p>Significant (50%) academic discounts are available to faculty, staff, and students of institutions of learning throughout the world. Academic discounts can be combined with quantity discounts, so that HOMER may be made available on classroom computers at a very reasonable price. Academic usage is limited to teaching and research - any commercial usage is strictly prohibited by our <a href="license.html">End User License Agreement</a>. We require proof of academic affiliation before academic orders can be completed. </p>
              <h2><a name="quotes" id="quotes"></a>Quotes and Invoices</h2>
              <p>Getting a quote is very easy. Simply create an order for HOMER 2 and then select the &quot;Print invoice&quot; button. There is now a place to add your own purchase order number, if one exists. If you want an electronic copy, you can print to PDF. Once the order has been approved, you can log back in and find your saved order(s) under the History-&gt;Orders menu. </p>
              <p>Unpaid orders will be kept in our system for 90 days. Invoices for paid orders remain available. Invoices for orders placed prior to March 24, 2014 are not available through the website - please contact us if you need an earlier invoice.</p>
              <h2><a name="payment" id="payment"></a>Payment Types</h2>
              <p>We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, Paypal, Bank transfer, and checks. All payment types except credit cards require interaction with us. We will contact you when your order has been paid and is ready for you.</p>
              <h2><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>HOMER 2 Licensing</h2>
              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>HOMER 2 uses a serial number/renewal code combination to license a single copy of the software on a single Windows operating system. Purchasing a &quot;license&quot; of HOMER 2 through this website allows you to generate a renewal code that is valid for 180 days after it has been generated. Purchased licenses that have not yet been &quot;used&quot; show up in your history as &quot;unassigned&quot;.  </p>
              <h2><a name="term" id="term"></a>License Term</h2>
<p>Each HOMER 2 renewal code is valid for 180 days after you generate it through the website. You do not have to reinstall HOMER 2 each time you renew. Once your term has expired, find your serial number (Help-&gt;About HOMER), generate a renewal code for that serial number through this website, and enter the renewal code into HOMER 2 via the License Management menu item. </p>
              <h2><a id="activating"></a>Activating and Assigning HOMER 2 Licenses</h2>
              <p>The History-&gt;Manage Licenses link lets you generate renewal codes for specific serial numbers. You may also assign a license to another person, if you are a license manager for a group or organization. Assigning a license makes it easier when the assignee requests support. <em>Please be sure to check the serial number of the computer you are licensing before you generate a renewal code. </em>Serial numbers change after a renewal code has been entered, so you need to check this each time you renew. Also, common errors include mixing the number zero (0) and the letter O. Should you accidentally generate a renewal code for an incorrect serial number, you will need to contact customer support to resolve the issue and get a working renewal code.</p>
              <h2><a id="permanent"></a>Are permanent or enterprise licenses available?</h2>
              <p>We have plans to make permanent licenses and enterprise licensing available in new products planned for release in 2014, but HOMER 2 is available strictly on a 6-month basis for a single computer. The manage licenses functionality combined with the bulk discount are meant to provide you with some of the benefits of enterprise or long-term licensing.</p>
              <h2><a id="sharing"></a>How many people can share a license?</h2>
<p>Licenses are for one computer. HOMER 2 will not work in a server environment. The complete <strong>End User License Agreement</strong> is <a href="license.html">here</a>. The quantity discounts that we now offer make it possible for organizations with multiple users to benefit from purchasing licenses in bulk.</p>
              <h2><a id="automatic"></a>Will my license automatically renew after the 6-month period?</h2>
              <p>The license does not automatically renew, and your credit card will not be charged until you renew come to the website and renew. You can begin the renewal process from within the software, and you will be automatically taken to our website where you can purchase a renewal code good for another 6-month period or generate a renewal code from a previously purchased, unassigned license.</p>
