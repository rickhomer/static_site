<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Background</strong>.&nbsp; Licensor owns and/or has the right to license the Software.&nbsp; Licensee desires to obtain a license to the Software on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.&nbsp; Now, therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree to the following.</li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Limited-Use License</strong>.&nbsp;Licensor hereby  grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, worldwide license to install a single copy of the Software for Licensee&rsquo;s  internal purposes (the &ldquo;<em>License</em>&rdquo;) on  a single use computer, except as noted in 2a, 2b, and 2g.  If Licensee is a Commercial User and has paid  the license fee for a Commercial User, the License shall also include the right  for Licensee to use the Software to provide analysis and other consulting  services for Licensee&rsquo;s clients.&nbsp; 
  <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
 
      <li>If Licensee has purchased a single license for a single  user, then Licensee has the right to install a single copy of the software on a  second computer, for their own use, so long as only one copy of Software is in  use by Licensee at a time.</li>
    
    <li>If Licensee has paid for a multi-user license, then the License may be used by the maximum number of simultaneous users specified in the receipt provided to Licensee.</li>
    <li>If the License term is perpetual, according to the receipt provided to Licensee, then Licensee may use it in perpetuity. </li>
    <li>Length of the license term is stated on the receipt provided to Licensee. Licensee understands that the Software will stop functioning after the period of the Limited Term license. Attempts to circumvent the term of the License will violate this License. In the event that this causes the Software to cease functioning, Licensee will be due no refunds.</li>
    <li>If the License is designated to be an Academic or Educational License, then use is restricted to educational and research purposes within an institution of learning or research. Commercial use is strictly prohibited, and such use will cause Licensee to owe Licensor the full value of the greatest difference in price between what was paid and what is currently advertised as the Commercial License price, plus a transfer fee of 10% of the final total price.</li>
    <li>If Licensee has downloaded a trial version (“Free Trial”), then such version may be used for evaluation purposes only, so that Licensee may determine if Software is suitable for its intended purposes. At the end of the trial period, the Software will cease to function. Licensee must either remove the Software and destroy any copies or purchase a License for its continued use. Any attempt to circumvent the limited term of the Free Trial will be a violation of this License and cause Licensee to owe Licensor an amount equal to the highest advertised cost of the Software times a multiplier of six (6).</li>
    <li>If Licensee has purchased an Enterprise or multiple user license, then the number of copies are restricted to the terms of that particular license, as outlined in the Invoice.</li>
    <li>If Licensee has downloaded the HOMER Legacy software (HOMER 2.68), Licensee owes no fees to Licensor but agrees to provide information on how the software will be used prior to downloading, installing, or using the Software, and upon renewal to provide information on how the software was used.</li>

In either case Licensee shall be liable for, timely pay, and  indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from and against, all applicable taxes and  duties of any kind (collectively, &ldquo;<em>Taxes</em>&rdquo;) imposed by any taxing  authority that are attributable to Licensee&rsquo;s use of the Software.</li>
