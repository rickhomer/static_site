        <h3>Aleph Baumbach, Support Engineer</h3>
        Aleph Baumbach graduated with two degrees: one in engineering (ABET accredited) and one in psychology from Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO. He believes that while engineering can help us improve the living systems and products that make our civilized world, that if we are to change to a more sustainable approach, change must arise from within. This is why he decided to pursue a double major in psychology – to study the inner human world – and engineering – to study how we can generate solutions to a variety of problems. As part of his interests in renewable energies, the environment, and sustainability, he served in the board of directors for the Environmental Center in Durango, CO for four years. He also was part of a project to bring potable water and a sanitation system for an indigenous village in Ecuador and in Laos with Engineers Without Borders. With his multi-cultural background, Aleph also speaks Spanish, Portuguese, and some German, which he uses to help HOMER’s customers worldwide with their technological issues as Support Engineer and Client Services Specialist.

        <h3>Rick Casey, DevOps Support</h3>
		Rick has been working in the software development field since 1992, but was always interested in computers, economics, social change and the energy field. His first degree in economics resulted in working in energy economics consulting for a time; but after witnessing the “PC revolution” first hand, was inexorably drawn more and more into programming, resulting in a degree in telecommunications from CU Boulder in 2002. Along the way he worked for a variety of software companies in the Denver/Boulder area, usually related to database development. Consequently, working at Homer Energy seems like the perfect culmination of his software career. He continues to teach an online course in environmental economics, part time for part of the year as a “hobby job” at Front Range Community College. Otherwise, he is often out enjoying the wonderful Colorado outdoors with friends, either hiking, camping, climbing, skiing or biking.
