<h2>HOMER Beta End User License Agreement</h2>
<p>This Software License Agreement (“<strong><em>Agreement</em></strong>”) is an agreement between you (“<strong><em>Licensee</em></strong>”) and HOMER Energy, LLC (“<strong><em>Licensor</em></strong>”) that sets forth Licensee’s rights and obligations with respect to the HOMER software and documentation (“<strong><em>Software</em></strong>”)
 that you are down-loading and installing from Licensor’s website. By 
downloading or accepting and installing the Software, Licensee agrees to
 the terms of this Agreement. Licensee agrees to abide by and be legally
 bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the 
limited-use license, the limited warranty, and the limitation of 
liability.&nbsp; By installing the Software, you also represent that you
 have the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the 
identified Licensee. If you do not agree, you should remove all copies 
of the Software from your computer or other media on which you have made
 copies of it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Note: This is a special version of the HOMER End User License 
Agreement for Beta and First Look versions. Please note items 9 and 10 
which have been added for this version.</p><br>

<ol style="list-style:decimal">
  <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Background</strong>.&nbsp; Licensor
 owns and/or has the right to license the Software.&nbsp; Licensee 
desires to obtain a license to the Software on the terms and conditions 
set forth in this Agreement.&nbsp; Now, therefore, for good and valuable
 consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby 
acknowledged, the parties hereby agree to the following.</li>
  <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Limited-Use License</strong>.&nbsp;Licensor
 hereby  grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable,
 worldwide license to install a single copy of the Software for 
Licensee’s  internal purposes (the “<em>License</em>”) on  a single use 
computer, except as noted in 2a, 2b, and 2g.&nbsp; If Licensee is a 
Commercial User and has paid  the license fee for a Commercial User, the
 License shall also include the right  for Licensee to use the Software 
to provide analysis and other consulting  services for Licensee’s 
clients.&nbsp; 
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
        <li>If Licensee has purchased a single license for a single  
user, then Licensee has the right to install a single copy of the 
software on a  second computer, for their own use, so long as only one 
copy of Software is in  use by Licensee at a time.</li>
        <li>If Licensee has paid for a multi-user license, then the 
License may be used by the maximum number of simultaneous users 
specified in the receipt provided to Licensee.</li>
        <li>If the License term is perpetual, according to the receipt provided to Licensee, then Licensee may use it in perpetuity. </li>
        <li>Length of the license term is stated on the receipt provided
 to Licensee. Licensee understands that the Software will stop 
functioning after the period of the Limited Term license. Attempts to 
circumvent the term of the License will violate this License. In the 
event that this causes the Software to cease functioning, Licensee will 
be due no refunds.</li>
        <li>If the License is designated to be an Academic or 
Educational License, then use is restricted to educational and research 
purposes within an institution of learning or research. Commercial use 
is strictly prohibited, and such use will cause Licensee to owe Licensor
 the full value of the greatest difference in price between what was 
paid and what is currently advertised as the Commercial License price, 
plus a transfer fee of 10% of the final total price.</li>
        <li>If Licensee has downloaded a trial version (“Free Trial”), 
then such version may be used for evaluation purposes only, so that 
Licensee may determine if Software is suitable for its intended 
purposes. At the end of the trial period, the Software will cease to 
function. Licensee must either remove the Software and destroy any 
copies or purchase a License for its continued use. Any attempt to 
circumvent the limited term of the Free Trial will be a violation of 
this License and cause Licensee to owe Licensor an amount equal to the 
highest advertised cost of the Software times a multiplier of six (6).</li>
        <li>If Licensee has purchased an Enterprise or multiple user 
license, then the number of copies are restricted to the terms of that 
particular license, as outlined in the Invoice.</li>
        <li>If Licensee has downloaded the HOMER Legacy software (HOMER 
2.68), Licensee owes no fees to Licensor but agrees to provide 
information on how the software will be used prior to downloading, 
installing, or using the Software, and upon renewal to provide 
information on how the software was used.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Restrictions; Requirements</strong>.&nbsp;
 The License does not include the right to, and Licensee covenants and 
agrees not to, (a) disclose all or any portion of the Software to any 
third party; (b) sell, license, sublicense, distribute or otherwise 
transfer all or any portion of the Software to any third party; or (c) 
modify, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works from, all or 
any portion of the Software.&nbsp; Licensee will not remove, distort, 
relocate, resize, or otherwise modify in any way any copyright, 
trademark or other proprietary notices that appear in the Software.</li>
  <li><strong>Fees; Taxes</strong>.&nbsp;Licensee may have paid Licensor
 a license fee prior  to downloading, installing or using the 
Software.&nbsp; If Licensee has downloaded Software for which  no fees 
have been paid, and which has been advertised or identified as being  
Free, Licensee agrees to provide information on how the software will be
 used  prior to downloading, installing, or using the Software, and upon
 renewal of  the License. In either case Licensee shall be liable for, 
timely pay, and  indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from and against, 
all applicable taxes and  duties of any kind (collectively, “<em>Taxes</em>”) imposed by any taxing  authority that are attributable to Licensee’s use of the Software.</li>
  <li><strong>Ownership</strong>.&nbsp; Licensee acknowledges that (i) 
all right, IP Rights, title, ownership and interest in and to the 
Software will at all times remain with Licensor, and (ii) Licensee has 
no rights in the Software except those expressly granted by this 
Agreement. &nbsp;Licensee will take reasonable steps to protect the 
Software from any use that is not specifically authorized by this 
Agreement.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited Warranty</strong>.
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha"><li> Licensor warrants that (i) 
that it owns or has the right to license Software to Licensee hereunder,
 and (ii) it has not granted any exclusive rights with respect to the 
Software or any part thereof to any third party or otherwise granted any
 rights that are inconsistent with the rights granted hereunder.</li>
      <li>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 6(a), THE SOFTWARE IS 
PROVIDED TO LICENSEE STRICTLY ON AN “AS IS” BASIS.&nbsp; THERE ARE NO 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE, ORIGINALITY, RESULTS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE SOFTWARE OR 
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
 THE SOFTWARE.&nbsp; LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR 
GUARANTY AS TO THE RELIABILITY, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY, 
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SOFTWARE.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>.&nbsp; The parties agree 
to be responsible for their respective use of the Software.&nbsp; 
Neither party shall be liable to each other or to a third party for any 
loss or damage claimed to have resulted from the use, marketing, 
operation or performance of the Software or related in any way to its 
acquisition, regardless of the form of action.</li>
  <li><strong>General.</strong>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha"><li>This Agreement shall be 
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and 
their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that any 
attempt by Licensee to assign this Agreement shall be void without the 
express written prior consent of Licensor which may be withheld in its 
sole discretion, except that Licensee may assign this Agreement upon 
notice to the Company to any affiliate of Licensee and in connection 
with any sale by Licensee of substantially all of its assets relating to
 the Software.</li>
      <li>All rights and remedies of the parties hereto are separate and
 cumulative.&nbsp; The waiver or failure of either party to exercise in 
any respect any right or remedy provided herein shall not be deemed a 
waiver of any further right or remedy hereunder.
      </li>
      <li>This Agreement shall be subject to, governed by, and construed
 in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to 
any of its conflict of laws provisions that would cause the laws of 
another jurisdiction to apply.&nbsp; Any action or proceeding relating 
to this Agreement must be brought in a federal or state court in Denver 
or Boulder County, Colorado and each party irrevocably submits to the 
jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or 
proceeding.&nbsp; If any legal action is brought to enforce this 
Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive its costs, 
expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees, in addition to any other relief
 it may receive.</li>
      <li>The invalidity of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity and binding effect of any other provision.</li>
      <li>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the 
parties on the subject hereof and supersedes all prior or 
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, representations and proposals,
 written or oral.</li>
      <li>Licensor may modify, supplement, or change this Agreement from
 time to time by publishing changes at this website where this License 
is displayed. Licensor will make every effort to notify Licensee of 
these changes via email to the address under which Licensee registered 
the Software.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Special Conditions for Beta Products</strong>. <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">This
 is a beta or "first look" product that is released only for the purpose
 of customer feedback and bug discovery. This product has a definite 
expiration date after which it will stop working. The beta software 
licensed hereunder is believed to contain defects, and a primary purpose
 of this beta testing license is to obtain feedback on software 
performance and identification of defects. Licensee is advised to 
safeguard important data, to use caution, and not to rely in any way on 
the correct functioning or performance of the software or accompanying 
materials.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Privacy and data.</strong> Hitting the "Calculate" button 
on this product will send a copy of Licensee's .homer file (HOMER file) 
to a server that will store the file and its association with your HOMER
 user profile, collected through Licensor's website, in a secure 
location. Licensor will not sell or share HOMER files or use any 
information collected under this License to any third party or use it 
for any purposes other than testing the data warehousing capability of 
the Beta or First Look product. Licensor may examine your file for the 
purposes of testing the data warehousing system. </li>

<p>This Software License Agreement (“<strong><em>Agreement</em></strong>”) is an agreement between you (“<strong><em>Licensee</em></strong>”) and HOMER Energy, LLC (“<strong><em>Licensor</em></strong>”) that sets forth Licensee’s rights and obligations with respect to the HOMER software and documentation (“<strong><em>Software</em></strong>”)
 that you are down-loading and installing from Licensor’s website. By 
downloading or accepting and installing the Software, Licensee agrees to
 the terms of this Agreement. Licensee agrees to abide by and be legally
 bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the 
limited-use license, the limited warranty, and the limitation of 
liability.&nbsp; By installing the Software, you also represent that you
 have the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the 
identified Licensee. If you do not agree, you should remove all copies 
of the Software from your computer or other media on which you have made
 copies of it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Note: This is a special version of the HOMER End User License 
Agreement for Beta and First Look versions. Please note items 9 and 10 
which have been added for this version.</p><br>

<ol style="list-style:decimal">
  <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Background</strong>.&nbsp; Licensor
 owns and/or has the right to license the Software.&nbsp; Licensee 
desires to obtain a license to the Software on the terms and conditions 
set forth in this Agreement.&nbsp; Now, therefore, for good and valuable
 consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby 
acknowledged, the parties hereby agree to the following.</li>
  <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Limited-Use License</strong>.&nbsp;Licensor
 hereby  grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable,
 worldwide license to install a single copy of the Software for 
Licensee’s  internal purposes (the “<em>License</em>”) on  a single use 
computer, except as noted in 2a, 2b, and 2g.&nbsp; If Licensee is a 
Commercial User and has paid  the license fee for a Commercial User, the
 License shall also include the right  for Licensee to use the Software 
to provide analysis and other consulting  services for Licensee’s 
clients.&nbsp; 
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
        <li>If Licensee has purchased a single license for a single  
user, then Licensee has the right to install a single copy of the 
software on a  second computer, for their own use, so long as only one 
copy of Software is in  use by Licensee at a time.</li>
        <li>If Licensee has paid for a multi-user license, then the 
License may be used by the maximum number of simultaneous users 
specified in the receipt provided to Licensee.</li>
        <li>If the License term is perpetual, according to the receipt provided to Licensee, then Licensee may use it in perpetuity. </li>
        <li>Length of the license term is stated on the receipt provided
 to Licensee. Licensee understands that the Software will stop 
functioning after the period of the Limited Term license. Attempts to 
circumvent the term of the License will violate this License. In the 
event that this causes the Software to cease functioning, Licensee will 
be due no refunds.</li>
        <li>If the License is designated to be an Academic or 
Educational License, then use is restricted to educational and research 
purposes within an institution of learning or research. Commercial use 
is strictly prohibited, and such use will cause Licensee to owe Licensor
 the full value of the greatest difference in price between what was 
paid and what is currently advertised as the Commercial License price, 
plus a transfer fee of 10% of the final total price.</li>
        <li>If Licensee has downloaded a trial version (“Free Trial”), 
then such version may be used for evaluation purposes only, so that 
Licensee may determine if Software is suitable for its intended 
purposes. At the end of the trial period, the Software will cease to 
function. Licensee must either remove the Software and destroy any 
copies or purchase a License for its continued use. Any attempt to 
circumvent the limited term of the Free Trial will be a violation of 
this License and cause Licensee to owe Licensor an amount equal to the 
highest advertised cost of the Software times a multiplier of six (6).</li>
        <li>If Licensee has purchased an Enterprise or multiple user 
license, then the number of copies are restricted to the terms of that 
particular license, as outlined in the Invoice.</li>
        <li>If Licensee has downloaded the HOMER Legacy software (HOMER 
2.68), Licensee owes no fees to Licensor but agrees to provide 
information on how the software will be used prior to downloading, 
installing, or using the Software, and upon renewal to provide 
information on how the software was used.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Restrictions; Requirements</strong>.&nbsp;
 The License does not include the right to, and Licensee covenants and 
agrees not to, (a) disclose all or any portion of the Software to any 
third party; (b) sell, license, sublicense, distribute or otherwise 
transfer all or any portion of the Software to any third party; or (c) 
modify, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works from, all or 
any portion of the Software.&nbsp; Licensee will not remove, distort, 
relocate, resize, or otherwise modify in any way any copyright, 
trademark or other proprietary notices that appear in the Software.</li>
  <li><strong>Fees; Taxes</strong>.&nbsp;Licensee may have paid Licensor
 a license fee prior  to downloading, installing or using the 
Software.&nbsp; If Licensee has downloaded Software for which  no fees 
have been paid, and which has been advertised or identified as being  
Free, Licensee agrees to provide information on how the software will be
 used  prior to downloading, installing, or using the Software, and upon
 renewal of  the License. In either case Licensee shall be liable for, 
timely pay, and  indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from and against, 
all applicable taxes and  duties of any kind (collectively, “<em>Taxes</em>”) imposed by any taxing  authority that are attributable to Licensee’s use of the Software.</li>
  <li><strong>Ownership</strong>.&nbsp; Licensee acknowledges that (i) 
all right, IP Rights, title, ownership and interest in and to the 
Software will at all times remain with Licensor, and (ii) Licensee has 
no rights in the Software except those expressly granted by this 
Agreement. &nbsp;Licensee will take reasonable steps to protect the 
Software from any use that is not specifically authorized by this 
Agreement.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited Warranty</strong>.
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha"><li> Licensor warrants that (i) 
that it owns or has the right to license Software to Licensee hereunder,
 and (ii) it has not granted any exclusive rights with respect to the 
Software or any part thereof to any third party or otherwise granted any
 rights that are inconsistent with the rights granted hereunder.</li>
      <li>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 6(a), THE SOFTWARE IS 
PROVIDED TO LICENSEE STRICTLY ON AN “AS IS” BASIS.&nbsp; THERE ARE NO 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE, ORIGINALITY, RESULTS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE SOFTWARE OR 
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
 THE SOFTWARE.&nbsp; LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR 
GUARANTY AS TO THE RELIABILITY, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY, 
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SOFTWARE.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>.&nbsp; The parties agree 
to be responsible for their respective use of the Software.&nbsp; 
Neither party shall be liable to each other or to a third party for any 
loss or damage claimed to have resulted from the use, marketing, 
operation or performance of the Software or related in any way to its 
acquisition, regardless of the form of action.</li>
  <li><strong>General.</strong>
    <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha"><li>This Agreement shall be 
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and 
their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that any 
attempt by Licensee to assign this Agreement shall be void without the 
express written prior consent of Licensor which may be withheld in its 
sole discretion, except that Licensee may assign this Agreement upon 
notice to the Company to any affiliate of Licensee and in connection 
with any sale by Licensee of substantially all of its assets relating to
 the Software.</li>
      <li>All rights and remedies of the parties hereto are separate and
 cumulative.&nbsp; The waiver or failure of either party to exercise in 
any respect any right or remedy provided herein shall not be deemed a 
waiver of any further right or remedy hereunder.
      </li>
      <li>This Agreement shall be subject to, governed by, and construed
 in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to 
any of its conflict of laws provisions that would cause the laws of 
another jurisdiction to apply.&nbsp; Any action or proceeding relating 
to this Agreement must be brought in a federal or state court in Denver 
or Boulder County, Colorado and each party irrevocably submits to the 
jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or 
proceeding.&nbsp; If any legal action is brought to enforce this 
Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive its costs, 
expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees, in addition to any other relief
 it may receive.</li>
      <li>The invalidity of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity and binding effect of any other provision.</li>
      <li>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the 
parties on the subject hereof and supersedes all prior or 
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, representations and proposals,
 written or oral.</li>
      <li>Licensor may modify, supplement, or change this Agreement from
 time to time by publishing changes at this website where this License 
is displayed. Licensor will make every effort to notify Licensee of 
these changes via email to the address under which Licensee registered 
the Software.</li>
